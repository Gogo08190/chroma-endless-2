Crafting CPUs can be tailored to exclusively respond to these automated requests, thus ensuring that they don't occupy CPUs designated for crafts requested by players.",
  "chapter.ae.quest.21.description.2": "When the &6Level Emitter&r is augmented with the Crafting Card, it gains the capacity to emit redstone signals that directly contribute to crafting processes. This can manifest in two ways: emitting a signal &owhile&r a crafting job for the specified item is detected or issuing a signal &oto&r initiate the crafting of the item itself. The latter scenario is particularly relevant for situations where a redstone signal is all that's required to produce a specific item, circumventing the need for a conventional crafting pattern.",

  "chapter.ae.quest.22.description.1": "To simplify tasks, AE2 offers a comprehensive array of devices tailored for the manipulation of ME data, essentially facilitating the movement of stored items throughout the world.",
  "chapter.ae.quest.22.description.2": "The &bME Interface&r stands as one of these devices. Functioning as an input mechanism, the Interface grants the capability to channel various items, fluids, and more externally through it. These incoming resources are subsequently automatically integrated into the connected ME Network, streamlining the storage process.",
  "chapter.ae.quest.22.description.3": "When employed as an output device, the Interface can be set up to maintain a designated quantity of a stored item in stock, ensuring a certain supply is retained within its internal inventory from the ME network. This arrangement facilitates the subsequent transfer of items to an external destination, such as another player or a piping system.",

  "chapter.ae.quest.23.description.2": "Storage buses can be configured with filters and assigned distinct priorities. This configuration enables specific items to first attempt placement in the linked storage. However, it's important to note that the storage bus does not retroactively relocate filtered items from other locations within the network to the attached storage.",

  "chapter.ae.quest.24.subtitle.1": "Filter Upgrade",
  "chapter.ae.quest.24.description.1": "The &bCapacity Card&r provides the enhancement of expanding the filter capacity of a bus it's installed in. When Import and Export buses are upgraded with capacity cards, they transition from accommodating a solitary filtered item to their full potential of a nine-slot filter. Similarly, Storage buses undergo a transformation from having 18 slots to supporting up to 63 slots with the aid of a capacity card.",

  "chapter.ae.quest.27.description.2": "An additional advantage of the Annihilation Plane is its susceptibility to enchantments, akin to regular digging tools. These enchantments influence block drops in a manner consistent with how the corresponding enchanted tool functions. Consequently, when enchanted with Fortune, for instance, the Annihilation Plane becomes particularly adept at processing ore blocks.",
  "chapter.ae.quest.27.description.3": "Incorporating enchantments substantially escalates the energy consumption of the Annihilation Plane with each block it breaks. When augmented with the &6Efficiency&r enchantment, the overall energy usage for all other enchantments is reduced. On the other hand, the &6Unbreaking&r enchantment grants the plane the potential to consume energy intermittently, akin to how Unbreaking operates on conventional tools.",

  "chapter.ae.quest.28.subtitle.1": "Applied to Storage",
  "chapter.ae.quest.28.description.1": "The &bME Export Bus&r operates by intermittently ejecting items listed in its whitelist filter to an external storage destination that the bus is oriented towards. Unlike the Import Bus, the Export Bus is reliant on having a filter in place and cannot function without one.",

  "chapter.ae.quest.29.subtitle.1": "Applied Placer",
  "chapter.ae.quest.29.description.1": "The &bME Formation Plane&r functions in a manner reminiscent of the Storage Bus, but it treats the surrounding world as its storage medium. In practical terms, this means that the plane is capable of placing any block from its filter directly in front of itself within the game world.",
  "chapter.ae.quest.29.description.2": "This capability can be advantageous in scenarios where a block can be conveniently processed by placing it down and subsequently breaking it with a specific tool.",

  "chapter.ae.quest.30.subtitle.1": "First Cable",
  "chapter.ae.quest.30.description.1": "An integral concept in AE2 is the practice of '&6subnetting&r,' involving the creation of an additional and distinct ME network referred to as a '&6subnetwork&r.' This subnetwork collaborates with the main network to carry out specialized functions or processes.",
  "chapter.ae.quest.30.description.2": "What distinguishes a subnetwork from a completely separate and independent network is often the utilization of &bQuartz Fiber&r as a cable component. When positioned between two segments of cable that would otherwise remain unconnected, the Quartz Fiber facilitates the transmission of power exclusively, refraining from transferring any data or channels between the two segments.",
  "chapter.ae.quest.30.description.3": "As a result, a subnetwork located on the opposite end of the Fiber can be entirely powered by the primary network's energy source, eliminating the need for additional dedicated power generation.",

  "chapter.ae.quest.31.subtitle.1": "Tunneling",
  "chapter.ae.quest.31.description.1": "The &bP2P&r (peer-to-peer) system serves as a potent mechanism within AE2, enabling the seamless transfer of items, fluids, and various other entities without necessitating the involvement of any intermediary ME storage units.",
  "chapter.ae.quest.31.description.2": "Interacting with a P2P tunnel through a right-click action using specific items will trigger an &6attunement&r process. This procedure transforms the tunnel into one that is adept at transmitting different types of entities, like items through pipes, energy via cables, redstone signals, and even (by default) ME connections themselves.",
  "chapter.ae.quest.31.description.3": "For the linkage of P2P tunnels, the utilization of a &6Memory Card&r is imperative. Further information about this component is provided in the subsequent quest.",

  "chapter.ae.quest.32.description.2": "The second function of a memory card involves the linking of &6P2P tunnels&r. During this process, the P2P tunnel being linked will receive a unique identifier, which is then stored on the memory card for subsequent linking operations.",

  "chapter.ae.quest.37.description.3": "Cable Anchors are also essential for crafting &bCable Facades&r. These facades let you seamlessly integrate cables into walls by masking them with the appearance of any chosen block. Although facade recipes aren't displayed in JEI, you can craft them by encircling a standard block with 4 cable anchors in the crafting grid.",
  "chapter.ae.quest.37.description.4": "Beyond crafting anchors, the cutting knife offers another function. Right-clicking with it opens a GUI that lets you craft &bInscriber Name Presses&r. Once named, these presses can rename items inside an Inscriber based on the press's name.
